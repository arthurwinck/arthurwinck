### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at UFSC and currently working at Bridge Labs and Pixel Web Development!  I have experience working with Python and JS. I seek to learn more about web development, data science and game development. Always searching for some problemas to solve, feel free to send me a message!
